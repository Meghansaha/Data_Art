# Data_Art
Playground for practicing/trying data art.
Things I'd like to do:
  - Understand the capabilities of geom_shapes in ggplot
  - Understand Trig and geometric equations more
  - Test the capabilities of creating data art in R
  - Have fun and learn that it's OK to just appreciate data in art form.
